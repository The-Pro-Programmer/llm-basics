Prompt Engineering
- Prompt Engineering is the foundational art and science of designing and optimizing the input (prompts) given to an LLM to achieve a desired and consistent output.
- Focus: Single, refined input to get a single, optimal output from the LLM. It's about crafting the best question or instruction.
- Techniques: Involves strategies like defining a role (e.g., "Act as a financial analyst"), providing specific constraints, or using advanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to encourage reasoning.
- No autonomy. It needs human correction.


Chains
- A Chain is a structural pattern where a series of sequential steps are executed, where the output of one step serves as the input for the next. These steps can include multiple LLM calls or other operations.
- Focus: Decomposing a complex problem into smaller, manageable, and sequential sub-tasks. It's about creating a fixed, multi-step pipeline.
- Structure: Often involves multiple prompts (prompt chaining), data transformations, or fixed calls to external tools in a predefined order.
- Complexity: More complex than simple prompt engineering, allowing for better handling of multi-step processes with improved reliability and interpretability.
- It has low autonomy. Initially human needs to decide on steps.


AI Agents
- An AI Agent is an LLM-based system that can autonomously plan, reason, and act to achieve a complex goal. 
- Unlike a fixed chain, an agent can dynamically decide which tools to use and what - the next step should be.
- Focus: Executing a complex, end-to-end task in a dynamic environment by making independent decisions. It's about creating an autonomous problem-solver.
- Key Components: Typically includes a Planning module (to break down the task), Memory (to retain information across steps), and Tool Use (to interact with external systems like search engines or code interpreters).
- Complexity: The most advanced level, as the agent's behavior is not hard-coded but determined dynamically by the LLM (the "brain") in response to observations and its goal.
- It has high autonomy. It can decide next step and tool.


Complexity: The simplest level of interaction, requiring constant human input for new tasks.
AI Agents:
- For AI agents, LLM are decision making engines
- Agentic Behavior
    - Routing
    - Tool selection
    - Quality check
- Key characteristics of AI agents
    - Reasoning and planning
    - Action and tool used
    - Memory
    - Reflection
- Examples:
    - Wikepedia style article generator
    - Code generator / Test case generator
    - Web navigation via AI agent

Reasoning
- Reasoning is a fundamental human cognitive process that enables decision making, problem solving
- It is also used to break tasks into subtasks

Pattern Recognition and True Reasoning:
- LLM's core task is pattern recognition. 
- They can simulate reasoning by mimicking logical structures
- LLM lack common sense and they do not have any real goal or motivation or awareness
- Their reasoning ability comes from comprehensive training on complex data
- Reasoning frameworks:
    - ReAct frameworks
    - Chain-of-thoughts prompting

Tools:
- Tools are API's, external functions which AI agents can use
- AI agents can perform below actions on tools
    - Read
    - Write
- Examples: Agents can use calendar APi to plan holidays


LangChain:
- LangChain is an open source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLM
- Key Components:
    - Chains
    - Prompt management
    - Agents
    - Vector database
    - Models
- LangChain Pipeline:
    - LangChain pipeline is a structured sequence of steps where each step performs a specific task in the LLLM workflow
    - Output of one step becomes input of next step


ReAct framework:
- ReAct stands for Reasoning and Acting
- ReAct agents outperform zero-short prompting and other methods
- It has enhanced trustworthiness
- ReAct agents can get stuck in their thought loop - it can resolved by putting limit on maximum number of thought iterations
- Also, ReAct has no scalability as they have only one agent


Single Vs Multi Agent Architectures:
- Single agent architectures: 
    - Are good for simple and straight forward flows
    - Easy to implement and enhanced
    - Lack of parallelism
- Multi agent architectures:
    - Group of more than one singe agent which can communicate with each other to complete tasks
    - Each agent is focused on what they do best
    - There is parallelism
    - These are scalable
    - These system tend to be complex
    - Risk of dominoes failure


LangGraph:
- LangGraph is an opensource framework built by LangChain
- It can streamline the creation and management of AI agent workflows
